Counting Trees Problems
1. the number of partitions of an n-element set into ki i-element classes ( i = 1, 2, ..., n ) is n! / (1!k1k1!2!k2k2!...n!nkn!).
2. The semilabelled binary trees with k leaves are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of a 2k - 2 element set into 2-elementsubsets, and their number is (2k - 3)!!.
3. The semilabelled t-ary trees with m branching points are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of a (m + 1)t-element set into t-element classes, and their number is ((m + 1)t)!/(t!m+1(m + 1)!).
4. The number of semilabelled trees on n + 1 vertices with maximum degree at most d are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of an n-element set into classes not bigger than d.
5. The number of rooted labelled trees on n + 1 vertices with k leaves is n(n - 1)...(k + 1)S(n, n - k + 1).
6. The number of labelled trees on n + 1 vertices with k leaves is (n + 1)n(n - 1)...(k + 1)S(n - 1, n - k + 1).
7. The number of labeled trees on n vertices is n^n-2.
8. The number of rooted labeled trees on n + 1 vertices with a root degree k is equal to C(n - 1, k - 1)nn-k.
9. Suppose d0 + d1 + бн + dn = 2n. The number of labeled trees on n + 1 points with prescribed degrees d0, d1, бн, dn is equal to (n - 1)!/((d0 - 1)!...(dn - 1)!).
10. Suppose n0 = 1 + n2 + 2n3 + 3n4 + бн + (m - 1)nm. The number of rooted, unlabelled, ordered trees ( i.e., in which we order the subtrees hanging on the same point ) having ni vertices with out-degree i ( i = 0, 1, бн, m) is equal to (n0 + n1 + бн + nm иC 1)!/(n0!n1!...nm!).
11. The number of rooted unlabelled binary plane trees on 2n vertices is the Catalan number C(2n - 2, n - 1)/n.

s[i][1] = s[i][i] = 1
s[i][j] = s[i - 1][j - 1] + j * s[i - 1][j] (2 <= j < i)
